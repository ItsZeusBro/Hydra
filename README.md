### Use this schema as an example for your hydra.json file to create your API function scaffolds, invariants, and documentation


    apiFunctionName1:{
        invariant:{
 
        }
        
        functionParamName1: {
            type: someType
        }
        functionParamName2: {
            type: someVariadicType
        } 
    
    }
    
 ## Scope
 ### Hydra 0.1 is not meant to produce a production ready documentation server
 It is meant to aid your efforts in building out and testing your api's. It's a developer tool to speed things up.
 Eventually it will go the distance and professionalize into a production ready documentation tool.
