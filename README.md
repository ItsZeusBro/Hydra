# Hydra 
Hydra is a plugin architecture that generates all kinds of services needed for your application that compliment Hydra's native features.

Hydra aims to be a minimalistic Abstract Syntax that orchastrates other orchastrating Syntax plugins

Hydra tells us that: when we can code abstractly we should. The plugins aim to show us why. Overtime, this type of Abstract Syntax will allow us to do a lot more in the way of code generation, and probably a ton of other cool things we don't know about with fewer lines of code. Opportunities arise out of abstraction.

The plugins are there to give context and opinion to your Abstract Syntax. This will allow Hydra to read like pseudo code or even natural language one day, and every term of art will have a context and opinion informed by your plugins. In otherwords, some plugins conflict with others. Better yet, other plugins add nuance in there own pipelines. That looks like the mythical Hydra when its done.
